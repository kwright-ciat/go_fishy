Rules for Go Fish

The rules are modified from the standard Go Fish rules.

Two player game with user versus computer.

Each player is dealt seven cards to start game.

The cards not dealt to the players are put into the pile.

Randomly either the user or the computer goes fishing first.

A guess must be from a book from the rank of 2s up to Aces.

Guesses must be a number or the first letter of the rank.

If a guess is correct, then the player goes fishing again.

If a guess results in all four cards in the book, it is scored.

If a guess is wrong, the player must draw a card from the pile.

If the player draws the desired card, they keep fishing, otherwise,
the other player gets to go fishing.

When all thirteen books have been scored,  
or the pile is empty the game is over.

When the game is over, the player with the most books scored wins.

Shuffle the cards and deal 7 cards face down to each player. 
Deal 5 cards to each player if there are 4 or more players. 
Place the remaining cards face down in a draw pile where everyone can reach them. 
Arrange cards by number so that all the 1s are together, all the 2s are together, and so on. 

How to Play: The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues clockwise.
The first player asks a specific person if he or she has any cards of a specific number. 
For example, player one might ask player three if she has any 2s. 
Player one must have at least one 2 in his hand in order to ask for it. 
If player three has any 2s, she must give them all to player one. 
Player one may then go again and can continue playing until he does not get the card he asks for. 
If player three does not have any 2s, she says “Go fish!” and player one 
must take 1 card from the draw pile. 
If the picked card is the card he wanted, a 2, he must show it to all players 
and can then go again. If it is not the card he asked for, then it is the next person’s turn.
Once a player has collected 4 of a kind, he places the cards in front him. 
The game ends when either someone has no cards in his hand or the draw pile runs out.
